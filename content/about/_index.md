_Travelling is what I love to do as much as I can. With full time jobs for both my husband and I and 2 boys, sometimes it can be a challenge. Come follow me to learn more_

Hi, my name is Shetal, and I am of Indian origin, but born and raised in New Zealand, who currently since 2002 been residing in USA. I am a mother of 2 boys who like most people are the world to me. I am a Database Developer by profession and eventually want to use my database skills to grow my blog into something more.

My blogs are vacations my husband and I have taken with our children (even when they were younger), our parents and some that we did alone (the 2 of us). We (my husband and I) love to travel and decided to start writing about it, this is how Sky Travel Blogger came about. There are so many places I’ve traveled to in the past few years, so many places I dream to visit and so many ideas I have that I want to blog about. The list is never ending. Check out some of the things I plan to inform you about:

* My Vacations & Experiences
* Things to do in xxx place
* Tools that help you plan trips
* Itineraries we followed on our trips
* Local Recipes for your taste buds
* Travel Deals (which is where my database skills will come into play)

The whole reason why this blog has come up, is to share and the learn about others travel experiences, what people do and do not like about travelling, types of deals people want to receive (so we can eventually build something great and useful for everyone to use). I like to share the things I find important and would love this to not only be about me, but also about what you would like to see. So feedback is very important to me.

Traveling around the world with include Itineraries, things to do, our experiences and tools we used on each of our trips. You will learn about the following locations and so many more :

* Punta Cana – Dominican Republic
* Riviera Maya, Cancun, Los Cabos – Mexico
* Jamaica
* Costa Rica
* Puerto Rico
* China
* Italy
* Greece
* London
* Scotland
* so many more

Follow my page and hopefully with feedback we can build something great together. I plan to also post deals I find on my blog so follow me for updated travel deals I see. And important information. Subscribe with me, to receive detailed Itineraries on upcoming trips and trips we have already completed.
