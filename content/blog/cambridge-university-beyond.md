The trip started of with a visit straight to Cambridge. The boys and I left for London early than the rest of the group to spend a few days with family. Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport., its very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores.

Cambridge is very scenic,  with many places to see and visit. It can be covered in a day, but all depends on how much time you want to spend there, i loved the fact that the streets give you a sense of feel of inner peace and relaxation.

## Things to Do in Cambridge

##### 1. Punting along The Banks

<img style="padding: 0 10px; float: left;" src="/uploads/Punting.jpg" width="300"  height="225"/>

The banks is known as Little Venice. Punting is a great way to see the River Cams which separates Cambridge into 2 sections. With a glass of bubbly in your hands its a great way to view the inside of many of the Colleges right from the River and see the many exotic bridges the city has to offer.

##### 2. Visit the Bridge of Sighs

This is apparently Queen Victoria's favorite spot in Cambridge. It links the new court and the original college building of St John's College. Its used daily by people or live or work around there. Its very similar to its name sack in Venice, Italy.

##### 3. Visit the Mathematical Bridge

<img style="padding: 0 10px; float: right;" src="/uploads/Mathematical Bridge.jpg" width="400"  height="400"/>

This is a very interesting looking bridge that connects 2 parts of Queens College together. Its official name is the "Wooden Bridge", as its a wooden footbridge, but its derived the name of a Mathematical Bridge due to interesting situations.

The Bridge is actually made from straight timbers,  even though the shape of the bridge is an arch. Its a fairly interesting sigh as your punting down the river. Look up and review it from underneath.

##### 4. Take a University Tour

You can take a University Tour, or do a Self Guided tour visiting as many or little of the University Institutions or Colleges that you like. Each college is unique in its own way, so a pleasant afternoon to check out what each college has to offer.

# Cotwold Villages worth visiting

Cotswold for us was a day trip. We had a car at our disposal which was great since there were a lot of us. We packed a picnic of sandwiches, chips and drinks and we were off. Cotswold is an not too far from Cambridge fill of scenic rolling hills. Its actually quite amazing the way the hills lay.  Cotswold is made up of many tiny villages. We visited a couple of them. Both very different from each other, which gave them there own sense of uniqueness. This was a fun trip, and the kids had a place.

#### Bourton on the Water

<img style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;" src="/uploads/BourtonOnTheWaterStream.jpg" width="600"  height="800"/>

First we visited **Bourton on the Water**, its a small village with the cutest little river going thru it. Bourton has so many cute little tourist attactions to check out while there:

o Model Village - 1:9 replica of the village

o Model Railway

o Motoring Museum

o Birdland Park and Gardens (Great for kids and people who love birds)

o Dragon Maze

o Great walking Trails and Paths along the river

After strolling along the river and kids playing in the clean stream of water, we found the perfect spot to enjoy our lunch and enjoy the lively atmosphere of our surroundings. Definitely a lovely spot for relaxation and just a wonderful day out. There are some great ice cream shops right along the river too, so dont forget to grab a cone throughout the day.

#### Bibury

A tiny little village in Gloucestershire, England was not a place I was expecting to spend the second part of my day. After spending the morning in Bourton on the Water we drove to Bibury.

I don't think i had ever visited a village quite like this one.

<center><img src="/uploads/BiburyVillage.jpg" /></center>

Bibury is a small little town in the rural part of Cotswold. If you like quiet places then this place is definitely for you. It has a nice country feel to the town, which little path ways, a stream going thru the center, and cotswold stone cottages and walls giving the wonderful feel of the town.

Its a wonderful place for a picnic or to pick up some small items from the village shops. The main attraction in Bibury is the Bibury Trout Farm right off the main road. Its one of the oldest trout farms in the country, and has visitors from afar.
