Started of as a family trip (My husband and I with our 2 boys) soon became a trip to remember with friends and family. Total of 15 of us on a self guided trip to the Iconic city of London with a few excursions here and there.

We love to travel, and tend to find deals and come up with our own itineraries that we like to follow. My husband also loves photography. Its more of a passion or hobby, definitely not professional, but these are the images you will see in my posts.

Check out our Travels to the town of [Cambridge University and our visit to some lovely Cotswold Villages.](https://app.forestry.io/sites/dxxdura4wn0rvq/#/pages/content-blog-cambridge-university-beyond-md/ "Cambridge University & Cotswold") With a list of must see things to do.
