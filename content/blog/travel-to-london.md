Started of as a family trip (My husband and I with our 2 boys) soon became a trip to remember with friends and family. Total of 15 of us on a self guided trip to the Iconic city of London with a few excursions here and there.

We love to travel, and tend to find deals and come up with our own itineraries that we like to follow. My husband also loves photography. Its more of a passion or hobby, definitely not professional, but these are the images you will see in my posts.

The trip started of with a visit straight to Cambridge. The boys and I left for London early to spend a few days with family, not really with any more expectations. But i was really taken aback, Cambridge is such a beautiful little town. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport. Its very compact and cozy. So many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores
