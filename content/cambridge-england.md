Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport, it’s very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores. My cousin and her family live there, which is why we made the trip to spend time with them, but the trips was fantastic. So glad we visited

As we walked, we checked out many of the colleges along the way, Trinity Hall, Trinity College, Kings College. Even saw the Corpus Clock which was very interesting.

We were lucky enough to have a local tour guide with us. My cousin and her family live in Cambridge so they gave us the ins and outs of the little town.

Cambridge is very scenic, with many places to see and visit. It can be covered in a day, but all depends on how much time you want to spend there, I loved the fact that the streets give you a sense of feel of inner peace and relaxation.

We spent a lot of time around The Backs area, it was so peaceful, and the weather was beautiful. The sun was shining, and gave a beautiful reflection on the water. The geese also made it seem to naturalistic. There were students just sitting in the lawns and studying. It was the perfect student life on campus.

​Also, I think it must have been graduation time. There were a lot of gatherings going on inside the buildings, we even got to peak into one of the dining halls. They were setting up for an event. Not sure if we were allowed in, so we quickly strolled thru. My son managed to grab a picture though.

## Punting along the Backs

The backs is known as Little Venice. Punting is a great way to see the River Cams which separates Cambridge into 2 sections. With a glass of bubbly in your hands its a great way to view the inside of many of the Colleges right from the River and see the many exotic bridges the city has to offer.​

## Visit the Bridge of Sighs

This is apparently Queen Victoria’s favorite spot in Cambridge. It links the new court and the original college building of St John’s College. Its used daily by people or live or work around there. Its very similar to its name sack in Venice, Italy.

## Visit the Mathematical Bridge

This is a very interesting looking bridge that connects 2 parts of Queens College together. Its official name is the “Wooden Bridge”, as its a wooden footbridge, but its derived the name of a Mathematical Bridge due to interesting situations.  
​  
The Bridge is actually made from straight timbers, even though the shape of the bridge is an arch. Its a fairly interesting sigh as your punting down the river. Look up and review it from underneath.

### St John's College

Its the college where everyone wants to go now. It is Cambridge’s wealthiest college which is showcased by the annual May Ball (which is known to be one of the best parties in Britain)

Visiting St Johns College isn’t free. Its beautiful inside but costs to get in. Founded by Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1511, mother of King Henry VII, there is her coat of arms sitting above the Tudor Great Gate on St Johns Street. This college has great detail to look out for, like statues, carved doorways …

Kings College is the most read about in Cambridge. Founded in 1441 by Henry VI. The Kings College Chapel is a great work of art. Its a must see when visiting Cambridge.

## Find the Corpus Clock

Lets see if you can find the Corpus Clock within the city of Cambridge. Its a beautiful invention, its mechanically controlled, no programming involved at all. You wont spend long looking at the clock but definitely nice to check out.

## Visit the nearby Cotswold Villages

Cotswold for us was a day trip. We had a car at our disposal which was great since there were a lot of us. We packed a picnic of sandwiches, chips and drinks and we were off. Cotswold is an not too far from Cambridge fill of scenic rolling hills. Its actually quite amazing the way the hills lay. Cotswold is made up of many tiny villages. We visited a couple of them. Both very different from each other, which gave them there own sense of uniqueness. This was a fun trip, and the kids had a place.

## Bourton on the Water

<center><img src="/uploads/BourtonOnTheWaterStream.jpg" alt="Bourton On The Water"  style="width: 50%" /><figcaption> Bourton On The Water</figcaption></center>

First we visited <a href="https://www.bourtoninfo.com/" rel="nofollow">Bourton on the Water</a>, its a small village with the cutest little river going thru it. Bourton has so many cute little tourist attractions to check out while there:

* Model Village – 1:9 replica of the village
* Model Railway
* Motoring Museum
* Birdland Park and Gardens (Great for kids and people who love birds)
* Dragon Maze
* Great walking Trails and Paths along the river

After strolling along the river and kids playing in the clean stream of water, we found the perfect spot to enjoy our lunch and enjoy the lively atmosphere of our surroundings. Definitely a lovely spot for relaxation and just a wonderful day out. There are some great ice cream shops right along the river too, so don’t forget to grab a cone throughout the day.

## Bibury Village

A tiny little village in Gloucestershire, England was not a place I was expecting to spend the second part of my day. After spending the morning in Bourton on the Water we drove to <a href="https://www.bibury.com/" rel="nofollow">Bibury</a>.

I don’t think i had ever visited a village quite like this one.

<center><img src="/uploads/BiburyVillage.jpg" alt="Bibury Village"  style="width: 50%" /><figcaption> Bibury Village</figcaption></center>

<a href="https://www.bibury.com/" rel="nofollow">Bibury</a> is a small little town in the rural part of Cotswold. If you like quiet places then this place is definitely for you. It has a nice country feel to the town, which little path ways, a stream going thru the center, and Cotswold stone cottages and walls giving the wonderful feel of the town.  
Its a wonderful place for a picnic or to pick up some small items from the village shops. The main attraction in Bibury is the Bibury Trout Farm right off the main road. Its one of the oldest trout farms in the country, and has visitors from afar.
