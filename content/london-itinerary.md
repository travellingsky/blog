# Itinerary

We stayed in the Westminster District so this itinerary is from there

## Day 1  - Day of Arrival

* Arrive in Heathrow Airport London.
* Check into your hotel and relax
* Catch the Underground to Canary Wharf

Wonder the streets and take in the beauty

The Jubilee Line Underground brings you straight to Canary Wharf.

After spending as much time as you need at the Wharf, maybe even grabbing dinner

* Catch a local ferry back to Westminster. Advanced booking is generally not required but a ride down the River Thames is a great way to start your vacation in London

## Day 2 - Explore the City Side of London

* Westminster Cathedral

This is known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics in England and Wales. Its free to stroll through the Cathedral and is very nice and peaceful in there.

* Buckingham Palace (10 Min Walk from Westminster Cathedral)

The most famous place to visit while in London and the home to the Queen and the royal family. If timed correctly you’ll even manage to see the changing of the guards.

* Walk the Mall/ Chill at St James Park (2 Min Walk from the Palace)

A wonderful 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up to Trafalgar Square through the Admiralty Arch passing the St James Park on the way. If you have time, I highly recommend spending a bit of time relaxing on the lawns of the Park, it’s a nice resting spot and place to chill for a bit.

* Trafalgar Square (< 10 Min Walk from St James Park)

Located at the entrance to the Admiralty Arch, surrounded by many museums, shops and restaurants this is a place you can easy spend a bit of time. Also a great stop to grab a bit to eat. Its about a 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up the Mall, to a huge opening.

* Hyde Park (30 Min Walk or Catch the underground Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner)

After spending time at Trafalgar Square either walk or catch the underground to Hyde Park. A regular bus will also take you there. From the corner of the park you can explore the left and right side of the park, as each side has its own things to offer.

* Harrods (About a 5 Min Walk)

Million Square Feet of retail space to shop until you drop. Harrods has over 330 stores, cafes and restaurants inside, and all the brands your heart desires. Worth checking out especially because this is where all the celebrities love to shop.

* Kensington Palace / Kensington Gardens (28 Min Walk or Uber/Bus Ride to the Palace)

The current Royal residence for the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William & Kate). Lovely gardens surround this palace, and for those interested you can check out the inside of the palace with a purchase of a ticket and see some of Queen Victoria’s childhood in the exhibitions they have there.

## Day 3 - Explore the River Thames Area of London

* Westminster Abbey

Start the day out at Westminster Abbey. Highly recommended you buy tickets online before hand if you plan to take a tour of the abbey. Here was a 2 hour wait when we got there first thing in the morning. This is the Abbey where some of the big Royal Weddings, Coronations have happened. It is also where the Queen & Prince Phillip as well as Prince William and Princess Kate got married.

* Parliament Square (< 5 mins walking)

Only a hop skip away from Westminster Abbey, is the home of the members of parliament. Its an iconic spot in London that you can really miss.

* Big Ben (< 5 mins walking)

The Big Ben is located on the north corner of the House of Parliament. Its is located in the Elizabeth Tower overlooking the River Thames. Currently under refurbishment, but will be open in 2021. Currently you can see the clock thru the scaffolding, but because Parliament and the Big Ben are under construction its not really that impressive in my opinion. Will be nice when complete though.

* London Eye (10 Min Walk from Big Ben)

Cross over the bridge and as you observe the beauty of the river, you will see the London Eye in front of you on the left. Not far from the Big Ben is the wheel that will give you a 360-degree view of London’s skyline. We were short on time and lots to cover so we purchased the fast-track tickets and we didn’t have to wait too London to see the views from the skyline.

* Millennium Bridge (20 Min Walk from London Eye)

A beautiful walk down the Southbank along the River Thames to the Millennium Bridge is just what you need on a beautiful afternoon. This is an extraordinary looking footbridge, it’s a steel suspension bridge for pedestrians to cross the River Thames in London.

* London Bridge (15 Min Walk)

You won’t need much time here. The London Bridge is not the Tower Bridge as it confused most. This bridge is on the way to the Tower Bridge which covers the current crossing of the City of London and Southwark.

* Tower Bridge (15 Min Walk)

For us this was the highlight of our time in London. The Tower Bridge is just as beautiful if not more in real life than on TV. The large bridge is breathtaking, and with stunning that words cannot describe.

Tours can be taken of the towers of the tower bridge. We did not do it, but tickets are available for those interested. The bridge also opens up to large boats that travel the River Thames, so if you are able to catch that iconic moment its remarkable.

Spend a few hours hanging out on the lawns on the Southbank side of the bridge. For us it was a wonderful relaxing afternoon.
