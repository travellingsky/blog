# Itinerary

We stayed in the Westminster District so this itinerary is there

## Day 1  - Day of Arrival

* Arrive in Heathrow Airport London.
* Check into your hotel and relax
* Catch the Underground to Canary Wharf

Wonder the streets and take in the beauty

The Jubilee Line Underground brings you straight to Canary Wharf.

After spending as much time as you need at the Wharf, maybe even grabbing dinner

* Catch a local ferry back to Westminster. Advanced booking is generally not required but a ride down the River Thames is a great way to start your vacation in London

## Day 2 - Explore the City Side of London

* Westminster Cathedral

This is known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics in England and Wales. Its free to stroll through the Cathedral and is very nice and peaceful in there.

* Buckingham Palace (10 Min Walk from Westminster Cathedral)

The most famous place to visit while in London and the home to the Queen and the royal family. If timed correctly you’ll even manage to see the changing of the guards.

* Walk the Mall/ Chill at St James Park (2 Min Walk from the Palace)

A wonderful 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up to Trafalgar Square through the Admiralty Arch passing the St James Park on the way. If you have time, I highly recommend spending a bit of time relaxing on the lawns of the Park, it’s a nice resting spot and place to chill for a bit.

* Trafalgar Square

Hyde Park

Harrods

Kensington Palace

Kensington Garden

## Day 3 - Explore the River Thames Area of London
