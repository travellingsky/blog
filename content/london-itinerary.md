# Itinerary

We stayed in the Westminster District so this itinerary is from there

## Day 1  - Day of Arrival

* Arrive in Heathrow Airport London.
* Check into your hotel and relax
* Catch the Underground to Canary Wharf

Wonder the streets and take in the beauty

The Jubilee Line Underground brings you straight to Canary Wharf.

After spending as much time as you need at the Wharf, maybe even grabbing dinner

* Catch a local ferry back to Westminster. Advanced booking is generally not required but a ride down the River Thames is a great way to start your vacation in London

## Day 2 - Explore the City Side of London

* Westminster Cathedral

This is known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics in England and Wales. Its free to stroll through the Cathedral and is very nice and peaceful in there.

* Buckingham Palace (10 Min Walk from Westminster Cathedral)

The most famous place to visit while in London and the home to the Queen and the royal family. If timed correctly you’ll even manage to see the changing of the guards.

* Walk the Mall/ Chill at St James Park (2 Min Walk from the Palace)

A wonderful 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up to Trafalgar Square through the Admiralty Arch passing the St James Park on the way. If you have time, I highly recommend spending a bit of time relaxing on the lawns of the Park, it’s a nice resting spot and place to chill for a bit.

* Trafalgar Square (< 10 Min Walk from St James Park)

Located at the entrance to the Admiralty Arch, surrounded by many museums, shops and restaurants this is a place you can easy spend a bit of time. Also a great stop to grab a bit to eat. Its about a 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up the Mall, to a huge opening.

* Hyde Park (30 Min Walk or Catch the underground Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner)

After spending time at Trafalgar Square either walk or catch the underground to Hyde Park. A regular bus will also take you there. From the corner of the park you can explore the left and right side of the park, as each side has its own things to offer.

* Harrods (About a 5 Min Walk)

Million Square Feet of retail space to shop until you drop. Harrods has over 330 stores, cafes and restaurants inside, and all the brands your heart desires. Worth checking out especially because this is where all the celebrities love to shop.

* Kensington Palace / Kensington Gardens (28 Min Walk or Uber/Bus Ride to the Palace)

The current Royal residence for the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William & Kate). Lovely gardens surround this palace, and for those interested you can check out the inside of the palace with a purchase of a ticket and see some of Queen Victoria’s childhood in the exhibitions they have there.

## Day 3 - Explore the River Thames Area of London
