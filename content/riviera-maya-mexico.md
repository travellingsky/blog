Picking the right resort is essential when vacationing, and for us the <a href="[http://www.princess-hotels.com/en/hotels-riviera-maya-hotel-grand-sunset-princess-5-stars.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwzq63BRCrtIuGjImRoIIBEiQAGLHdYX9PcYLd3nOilTZTUFS0VnPWQsUFTUmmJ5qGLz6ptXIaAuAO8P8HAQ](http://www.princess-hotels.com/en/hotels-riviera-maya-hotel-grand-sunset-princess-5-stars.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwzq63BRCrtIuGjImRoIIBEiQAGLHdYX9PcYLd3nOilTZTUFS0VnPWQsUFTUmmJ5qGLz6ptXIaAuAO8P8HAQ "http://www.princess-hotels.com/en/hotels-riviera-maya-hotel-grand-sunset-princess-5-stars.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwzq63BRCrtIuGjImRoIIBEiQAGLHdYX9PcYLd3nOilTZTUFS0VnPWQsUFTUmmJ5qGLz6ptXIaAuAO8P8HAQ")" rel="nofollow">Grand Sunset Princess Resort</a> was perfect. We loved it so much that we recommended it to saw many people who all went there after us.

Right from the moment you walk into the foyer until the time you leave you feel like royalty. First we were greeted with a non alcoholic drink, which was nice and refreshing in the heat, before we even checked in for our room. The initial impression was "Wow".

After checking into the hotel, we decided to take a tour. It was beautiful place and so large. The grass was green, the walkways were spotless, well maintained which made the experience so pleasant.  
  
The huts were beautiful. They had little couches in there, great area to chill and relax. The pools were big and clean, with nice palm trees surrounding the water, and best of all, not a mosquito in site.   
  
There are so many restaurants to choose from and the food is great. Great variety of food in the buffet areas as well, as in the a la carte restaurants but you need to reserve at time check-in. Our favorite was the hibachi grill as it was the first time for the kids and my in-laws, so going through the hibachi experience was awesome. The chief was so entertaining. The buffets were good also. The changed up the food daily during dinner time so that was good, but for the picky eaters they did have the standard dishes everyday, which was great especially with kids, if they didn’t like the food at the restaurants then we had options.

## ​The Room - Laguna Villa

This trip happened to be during our 10 year anniversary. So my husband and I stayed in the Laguna Villa (which is in an adults only section of the resort), the kids stayed with my in-laws in a regular room at the resort.  
  
The rooms were both very beautiful, but we loved the Laguna Villa room. It’s had a wonderful outdoor shower. I have never experienced anything like that before; it was cool, and so unique. In the first picture below is the outdoor showers behind those french doors. The top of the shower is open, so you have a natural daylight shining in. Also there is an in room Jacuzzi, right behind the bed. It’s a perfect room for a romantic getaway.
