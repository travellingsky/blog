London the city of dreams. It’s the place where everything happens. So many movies are filmed there, books are based there and it’s a place that people love to travel to and its usually a stop over destination to so many countries.

We recently travelled to London with a group of family and friends. Check out my list of must-see places to visit in London and pictures from our travels

## 1) Canary Wharf

This is the business district of London. So many high rises that surround the district. <a href="https://canarywharf.com/" rel="nofollow">Canary Wharf</a> is a busy district especially during work hours with people working in the area. So, what is there to do in Canary wharf, there are many restaurants, gardens, museums all worth checking out. There are many events that happen at Canary Wharf, they have great venues for these events.

## 2) Westminster Cathedral

The <a href="http://www.westminstercathedral.org.uk/" rel="nofollow"> Westminster Cathedral </a> is where the seat of the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster is located and it’s also known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics of Wales and England. The Cathedral is free to visit and worth checking out. It has beautiful high altars and grand mosaics inside. The chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is on the north side of the sanctuary, and the Lady Chapel on the south.

## 3) Buckingham Palace

The home of the Queen and the Royal family. The <a href=" https://www.rct.uk/visit/the-state-rooms-buckingham-palace" rel="nofollow"> Buckingham Palace </a> you have to see while visiting London. Its mostly crowded with people but never the less checking out this palace is a must see in London. There are also tours available if interested in going inside. Tours of the interior of the palace is only available in the summer from late July until the end of September which the queen is on holiday in Scotland. If the Royal Standard Flag is flying that means the queen is in residences. If its not flying then the Union Jack is flown.

The changing of the Guards Ceremony happens daily at 11.30am when the Royal Guards change shifts.

## 4) The Mall

The Mall is a ceremonial road from Trafalgar Square leading straight to Buckingham Palace. You go through the Admiralty Arch passing Clarence House on the way. The walk is about 1km walk but it’s beautiful like walking on a red carpet. Its used for most royal processions and celebrations. Head of State are often escorted on horse and carriages up the Mall decorated with the Union Flags and flags from visiting head of state countries.
