## 3) Buckingham Palace & Changing of the Guard

The home of the Queen and the Royal family. The <a href="https://www.rct.uk/visit/the-state-rooms-buckingham-palace" rel="nofollow"> Buckingham Palace </a> you have to see while visiting London. Its mostly crowded with people but never the less checking out this palace is a must see in London. There are also tours available if interested in going inside. Tours of the interior of the palace is only available in the summer from late July until the end of September which the queen is on holiday in Scotland. If the Royal Standard Flag is flying that means the queen is in residences. If its not flying then the Union Jack is flown.

The changing of the Guards Ceremony happens daily at 11.30am when the Royal Guards change shifts.

## 4) The Mall

The Mall is a ceremonial road from Trafalgar Square leading straight to Buckingham Palace. You go through the Admiralty Arch passing Clarence House on the way. The walk is about 1km walk but it’s beautiful like walking on a red carpet. Its used for most royal processions and celebrations. Head of State are often escorted on horse and carriages up the Mall decorated with the Union Flags and flags from visiting head of state countries.

## 5) St James Park

This park is located right between Trafalgar Square and Buckingham palace. It’s a great spot if you want to chill and relax or kids want to ran around a bit. For people who love the nature it’s a nice spot to sit and read a book and take in the scenery.

## 6) Trafalgar Square

<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/our-building-and-squares/trafalgar-square" rel="nofollow">Trafalgar Square </a> is located in the middle of the city, right at the entrance to The Mall where the Royal Processions go thru. There are so many museums and shops around this popular area, but the center piece of Trafalgar Square is the Fountains and Statue in the center. The Columns & Statue were designed to honour Admiral Nelson, after his victory in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and the lions were designed to protect the Columns.

## 7) Hyde Park

London has many large parks, and Hyde Park is another one of them. Great place to relax and enjoy the sun. The park is used for many events so check the calendar to make sure the park isn’t taken over by events. We did have a triathlon going on the day we went so that sort of ruined it for us, but never the less it was still very beautiful if there weren’t as many people around.

I personally loved Princess Diana, so I wanted to check out the Diana Memorial Fountain while I was there

## 8) Harrods

Harrods is a large department store with over 330 branded stores, coffee shops and restaurants. You can easily spend a day here if you love all the brands. For us we had kids and the husbands so we weren’t able to spend too long here as they were all getting antsy, but the store is unique, it has a very classy feel to it.

You can find branded bags, purses, accessories, clothing, boots, food & wine whatever you desire if your wallet can afford it.

The store has over 1.1 million square feet of retail space and is the largest department store in Europe. It even has its own Zipcode which I think is interesting.

There is a dress code to shop at Harrods though. There have been celebrities that have been banned from the store for not complying.

NOTE: Forbidden items include uniforms; cycling shorts; high-cut shorts, Bermuda or beach shorts; swimwear; athletic singlets; flip flops or thong sandals; bare feet; bare midriff; or wearing dirty or unkempt clothing.

## 9) Kensington Palace/Kensington Gardens

This was the birthplace for Queen Victoria and the home of many of the Royal family members over the years. Currently the palace is the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William & Kate) and their children. You are allowed to visit the inside of the palace (buying the tickets before hand is highly recommended though). You can visit the right side of the palace along with the display areas, and state rooms as well as visit some of Queen Victoria’s exhibits. Kensington Garden is part of the palace surrounding the outer rim of the palace. Grand lake and ducks and birds love to hand out there. Is a nice walk with a great little coffee shop right at the start of the gardens overlooking the lake.

## 10) Westminster Abbey

This is where it all happens. The Westminster Abbey is located very close to the Buckingham Palace and its where most of the big ceremony’s take place, whether it’s a Royal Wedding, Coronations, such big royal events. The Queen & Prince Phillip got married at Westminster Abbey as well as Prince William and Princess Kate. The Abbey is a Gothic church and has rules that only people allowed to marry in the Abbey are members of the royal family, members of the Order of the Bath and their children and anyone who lives in the Abbey’s precincts. So, weddings here are very rare, but when they happen, they are very special.

The Abbey also has a burial ground next to it, where some of the Monarch is buried, others are buried in Frogmore in Windsor.

## 11) Parliament Square

Located minutes away from Westminster Abbey, this home of parliament in central London is a beautifully structured building, which embraces statues of 12 statesmen and other notable people in parliament. Many demonstrations and protests occur here also. You will find statues of people like Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George, Jan Smuts, Henry John Temple, Edward Smith-Stanley, Benjamin Disraeli, Sir Robert Peel, George Canning, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi & Millicent Fawcett.

## 12) Big Ben

Big Ben is actually called the Great Bell of the Clock, also known as the Clock Tower. Currently the clock is under construction as well as Parliament House but the face of the clock is still visible between the scaffolding. Tours of Big Ben are usually available but are currently suspended due to refurbishment. They are schedule to start back up in 2021.

## 13) Coca-Cola London Eye

You must buy tickets to ride the <a href="https://www.londoneye.com/" rel="nofollow"> London Eye</a>, but it’s the best way to see the skyline of the City of London. Located on the South Bank of the River Thames, it has become London’s most famous attraction. The London Eye stands 135 metres high of the group and allows you a great 25-kilometer view in every direction.

## 14) Millennium Bridge

This bridge is officially called the London Millennium Footbridge because its is a steel suspension bridge for people who want to cross the River Thames. The bridge is great access from the south bank to the north bank from the Shakespeare’s Globe to the St Paul’s Cathedral. The bridge looks really cool and the structure of it is unique.

## 15) London Bridge

The London Bridge often is confused with the Tower Bridge, but they look completely different. What we usually see in movies in the Tower Bridge. The London bridge is located not far from The Shard which is the tallest building in Europe.

## 16) Tower Bridge

<a href="https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" >Tower Bridge</a> is the icon of London. When London is shown in a movie, the first scene usually is of the Tower Bridge. Its 125 years old, and lights up like Disneyland at night.

Complete with Glass Flooring and tours available of the Towers on the bridge which takes you inside to show the engineering rooms and history of the bridge.

The bridge opens to incoming boards on the River Thames, and traffic stops on both sides to let the boats pass through. It’s a beautiful site to see it all in motion.

## 17) Tower of London

This is the official Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress. It’s a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames. Make sure you book your tickets to tour the castle, I personally wasn’t that interested in it, but boy was I wrong. I really enjoyed the inside tour. While inside since we are Indian most of the group wanted to see the Kohinoor diamond, that was our main attraction. The Kohinoor was nice but there were so many other beautiful crowns inside the Crown Jewels exhibit, it was very impressive.

Once you enter the Fortress, its tour at your own pace which is nice. So many little corners to check out. Kids love the Torture at the Tower and Bloody Tower exhibits. It’s a very interesting palace to explore and can easily take up a ½ day or more.

## 18) Madam Tussaud's

Tickets are required for Madam Tussaud's, and during holidays the lines are fairly large so book ahead of time. This is a great spot to see life-size wax replicas of icons from history as well as famous celebrities. Great options for picture taking for memories with your idols.

## 19) Oxford Street Shopping

Who doesn’t love shopping? Stroll down Oxford street to some great stores. You can find anything your looking for, whether it be souvenirs, clothing, household items, shoes you will find it all here. We had places to check out some of the British stores like Zara, Next …, but we were short on time. Some of the locals suggested a store called Primark and because it was recommended by many, we headed there first. Let’s just say 4 stories of shopping, we ran out of time. 4 Girls had a blast and bought so many things at great prices, that we had to revisit the store in Scotland, to buy more stuff. No affiliate with Primark, but definitely worth going to if you’re looking for deals. We all had to buy an extra carry on to bring back all our goodies.

## 20) St Paul’s Cathedral

<a href=”https://www.stpauls.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" > St Paul’s Cathedral</a> is the Cathedral with the large gold dome located in the center of the City of London. It is one of the most recognizable sites in London where many high profiles events also take place like the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer as well as the 80th & 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II were held. So much culture inside the Cathedral, and so many artworks, tombs and memorials to check out. Winston Churchill & Margaret Thatchers funerals were also held here.

## 21) Shard

The Shard is actually the Shard of Glass. It’s a 95 story tall skyscraper, the tallest building in Europe, hovering over The River Thames. Great place to wach the Sunrise or Sunset.

## 22) Shakespeare’s Globe

<a href=”https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/ " rel="nofollow" >Shakespeare’s Globe</a> is a performing arts venue, where cultural attractions and education seminars are held. There are so many productions you can go and see here at any time. This Globe was buld by an American actor Sam Wanamaker with the plan to build a recreation of Shakespeare’s Globe close to its original location which is at Bankside, Southwark.

## 23) Afternoon Tea at The Swan

Right next to the Shakespeare’s Globe is a restaurant called The Swan. This is where we had our afternoon tea. Make sure you book a time slot in advance. This afternoon tea was one of the cheaper ones we found, to try out the experience and we were not disappointed. We had a choice of the Midsummer Night’s Dream Afternoon Tea, which consisted of Savoury & Sweets items, and you could up charge for there signature drink in addition to the tea with a Love Potion Cocktail. Most of us up charged and loved it. We had so much food, and the scones were to die for.

## 24) London Day Trips

Some great Day Trips from London. We did a trip and covered so much area in a full day, money well spent. We visited Windsor, Stonehenge and Bath before heading back to London.

ADVICE:

Buy tickets to attractions before hand

Commuting from London Underground and/or Bus with the Bus pass is very easy to do and you get your money back on the bus pass for the money not spent. Well worth investing in.

Use Google Maps for directions. It makes things easier on routes to take, whether to take the bus or underground. Its all there in the palm of your hand.
