London the city of dreams. It’s the place where everything happens. So many movies are filmed there, books are based there and it’s a place that people love to travel to and its usually a stop over destination to so many countries.

We recently travelled to London with a group of family and friends. Check out my list of must-see places to visit in London and pictures from our travels

## 1) Canary Wharf

This is the business district of London. So many high rises that surround the district. <a href="https://canarywharf.com/" rel="nofollow">Canary Wharf</a> is a busy district especially during work hours with people working in the area. So, what is there to do in Canary wharf, there are many restaurants, gardens, museums all worth checking out. There are many events that happen at Canary Wharf, they have great venues for these events.

## 2) Westminster Cathedral

The <a href="http://www.westminstercathedral.org.uk/" rel="nofollow"> Westminster Cathedral </a> is where the seat of the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster is located and it’s also known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics of Wales and England. The Cathedral is free to visit and worth checking out. It has beautiful high altars and grand mosaics inside. The chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is on the north side of the sanctuary, and the Lady Chapel on the south.

## 3) Buckingham Palace

The home of the Queen and the Royal family. The <a href=" https://www.rct.uk/visit/the-state-rooms-buckingham-palace" rel="nofollow"> Buckingham Palace </a> you have to see while visiting London. Its mostly crowded with people but never the less checking out this palace is a must see in London. There are also tours available if interested in going inside. Tours of the interior of the palace is only available in the summer from late July until the end of September which the queen is on holiday in Scotland. If the Royal Standard Flag is flying that means the queen is in residences. If its not flying then the Union Jack is flown.

The changing of the Guards Ceremony happens daily at 11.30am when the Royal Guards change shifts.

## 4) The Mall

The Mall is a ceremonial road from Trafalgar Square leading straight to Buckingham Palace. You go through the Admiralty Arch passing Clarence House on the way. The walk is about 1km walk but it’s beautiful like walking on a red carpet. Its used for most royal processions and celebrations. Head of State are often escorted on horse and carriages up the Mall decorated with the Union Flags and flags from visiting head of state countries.

## 5) St James Park

This park is located right between Trafalgar Square and Buckingham palace. It’s a great spot if you want to chill and relax or kids want to ran around a bit. For people who love the nature it’s a nice spot to sit and read a book and take in the scenery.

## 6) Trafalgar Square

<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/our-building-and-squares/trafalgar-square" rel="nofollow” > Trafalgar Square </a> is located in the middle of the city, right at the entrance to The Mall where the Royal Processions go thru. There are so many musuems and shops around this popular area, but the center piece of Trafalgar Square is the Fountains and Statue in the center. The Columns & Statue were designed to honour Admiral Nelson, after his victory in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and the lions were designed to protect the Columns.

## 7) Hyde Park

London has many large parks, and Hyde Park is another one of them. Great place to relax and enjoy the sun. The park is used for many events so check the calendar to make sure the park isn’t taken over by events. We did have a triathlon going on the day we went so that sort of ruined it for us, but never the less it was still very beautiful if there weren’t as many people around.

I personally loved Princess Diana, so I wanted to check out the Diana Memorial Fountain while I was there

## 8) Harrods

Harrods is a large department store with over 330 branded stores, coffee shops and restaurants. You can easy spend a day here if you love all the brands. For us we had kids and the husbands so we weren’t able to spend too long here as they were all getting antsy, but the store is unique, it has a very classy feel to it.

You can find branded bags, purses, accessories, clothing, boots, food & wine whatever you desire if your wallet can afford it.

The store has over 1.1 million square feet of retail space and is the largest department store in Europe. It even has its own Zipcode which I think is interesting.

There is a dress code to shop at Harrods though. There have been celebrities that have been banned from the store for not complying.

NOTE: Forbidden items include uniforms; cycling shorts; high-cut shorts, Bermuda or beach shorts; swimwear; athletic singlets; flip flops or thong sandals; bare feet; bare midriff; or wearing dirty or unkempt clothing.

## 9) Kensington Palace/Kensington Gardens

This was the birthplace for Queen Victoria and the home of many of the Royal family members over the years. Currently the palace is the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William & Kate) and their children. You are allowed to visit the inside of the palace (buying the tickets before hand is highly recommended though). You can visit the right side of the palace along with the display areas, and state rooms as well as visit some of Queen Victoria’s exhibits. Kensington Garden is part of the palace surrounding the outer rim of the palace. Grand lake and ducks and birds love to hand out there. Is a nice walk
