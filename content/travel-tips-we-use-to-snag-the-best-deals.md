How to create your own Itinerary & plan your next trip

The key to travel is Plan Plan Plan. Yes there are spontaneous people our there and that's great if it works for you, but if your trying to travel on a budget then planning is the best way to go.

I'm going to share with you some tips and tricks we use when traveling. I'll update this blog as I come across more tricks, so make you you subscribe at the bottom of this blog for updates :)

Our vacations vary from either a couples trip (my husband and I), family trip (us and our kids) or trips with friends and family. Our record has been 16 people on a trip with us (including a 2 year old baby)

## 1) Choose a few destinations

Are there a list of places you really want to go, but just don't know where to start? We like to travel 1 country at a time, maybe adding a 2nd country if its going to be a short vacation to do only 1. We keep our options open.

So my husband and I, sit down and discuss where we would like to go next for our vacation. This is usually a general conversation over breakfast or lunch or even when we are walking outside, nothing formal.

We think of places where we think we may only need 5-7 days and other locations that may need more time like 10-12 days.

Then my husband gets to work. Yes he does most of the planning, and I do the guiding or approving at the end. On the odd occasion i will look something up but I get a verbal rundown on everything so i'm generally good.

**TIP :** You want to be able to book your next vacation at least 2-3 months in advance but our big vacations (10 days or more) we generally book 6 months in advance. Why so early you may ask? Because we are prepared to go on our next tour and deals area better when you book early vs book 2-3 months earlier. Also we find that most hotels are booked way out in advance in the time period we usually like to vacation, so we like to be ahead of the game.

Book 2-3 months in advance. We book almost 6 months earlier

## 2) Plan your ideal trip

So once we have decided on a couple of places we would like to visit, its time to research. What is ideal for us maybe not be ideal for you, but you can give it ago. We are not big on taking tours. Til date we have only done 1 tour together which was great but it has its up's and down's. Check out my China Blog for our experiences on that.

We actually have folders we create on our desktop with plans for different countries we want to visit. In the folders we start gathering information about what there is to do in each country, what actually interests us. To help us along the way, we took at different tours that are available from different websites. We mainly look at GateOne Travels, TravelZoo tours and Costco Travels and other peoples blogs to help guide us to our ideal vacation.

We take the highlights from each itinerary and create our own. This way we can add or remove cities, places we are or are not interested in visiting.

This does take a bit of time, but once complete the hard part is done.

Soon you will have a 10-12 day itinerary,  or a 5-6 day itinerary ready to be executed, knowing how long you need in each place is important, because once the deal is available you wont have time to go and do the research then, so advance planning is key. Its less likely that you will go back to the same place again if you have only missed one or two spots so you want to cover as much as you can.

If you like relaxing vacations then, this also works, pick what is important to you and plan some quite evenings out or time at the beach. If you know what you want to do then, it becomes simple.

## 3) Choose the best time for you

The hard task is done. You have a few different itinerary's, you may even have more if you have a whole list of places to visit but cant decide which one first.

Think about which is the best time for you to take your trip, this is important so you know which dates to search for.  Things about do you have hard dates you must follow, or can you adjust your schedule here or there. Our dates are usually hard dates, because of my husbands work schedule, to maximize our time off, without hurting his work schedule.

We take our major vacation (10-12 days) at the end of May beginning of June. Right when school is out for us here in Georgia. Kids are tired and we also need a break, but its the only real time to take such a long vacation without missing school. But others have different schedules, so think carefully about when is a good time for you to travel.

Weekend vacations we like to make use of the long weekends, and my husband and I like to take our couples vacation during the second half of the year when school is on. My thinking is, if school is out then the kids should come with us. I don't want to leave them with others when they are off, but if they are at school they are busy, so you don't feel so guilty leaving them behind ;)

## 4) Download Ebates

**_<ebates banner>_**

Believe me when I say to download <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates</a>. Originally I was a little skeptical as well, who gives you cash back for no reason right. Well wrong. To date and I have only been using Ebates for about a year or so, I've earned almost $1000 doing the things I would have done normally anyway. This doesn't apply only to travel but on all online purchases I do. I will be honest, i haven't had much luck with Ebates and Amazon, since Amazon doesn't allow cashback on everything, but Kohl's, Macy's, Groupon has saved me a lot of money.

<center><img src="/uploads/EbatesSample.jpg" alt="Ebates Sample"  style="width: 50%" /><figcaption> My Ebates Returns </figcaption></center>

Without getting too side tracked, Ebates actually works with travel booking sites as well.

Its very simple. All you have to do is sign up for Ebates (which is free), and download the plugin onto your internet bar at the top. You can also install the mobile app on your phone as well.

**Downside** is that you have to activate the plugin each time you do a booking. If you activate it and don't make a purchase or return a purchase you just won't get credited, so not harm done.

**Upside** is that you get free money. see above these bookings we did back in January.

We didn't actually take these vacations until June and July. A few weeks after we completed these vacations, we got the credit to our account, and at the end of the quarter we received a Big Fat Check in the mail. (Yep that's what Rakuten calls it).

After experimenting with shopping, and I saw the benefits my husband is also now well training to use Ebates. Its the best app ever in my opinion and did I say its FREE.

### How to use it

<center><img src="/uploads/EbatesActivation.jpg" alt="Ebates Activation"  style="width: 50%" /></center>

After you have downloaded <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates </a>onto your computer, and each time you go to a website the Purple R will start flashing or a popup with display letting you know that you can activate the deal. Hit The red button to activate and your in business. Just remember make sure the button is clicked on your session for your purchase to be recorded. I always click the Purple R right before i checkout just to double check. Cos even $1 or $2 here and there actually adds up. I use the <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/km8i18" rel="nofollow">Honey App </a> as well but I personally like Ebates better. Try them both and see what you prefer.

## 5) Bookings

### Book Hotels

You can book hotels using Expedia, Bookings.com or Hotels.com or any other site you find, but don't forget to active <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates </a> before checking out.

TIPS: Once you know which dates you are going to travel you can book your hotels before you even booked your flights.

Make sure you book refundable bookings in case something changes with your dates or itinerary.

Search and compare the <a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9165033-13268017?sid=5224213" target="_top"> top hotels </a> around the world <img src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-9165033-13268017" width="1" height="1" border="0"/>

### Book Flights

Booking flights is usually a huge expense. Once again <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates </a> is your friend. Ensure its active when you do your booking. Flights are usually not refundable.

If you book a non-direct flight then ensure you leave enough time in-between flights in case of delays.

Don't wait until the last minute to book your flights. Sometimes you may find a deal, but it doesn't mean it will meet your schedule. It works for spontaneous travelers mostly. Keep your eyes open for flight deals from <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9165033-12532525?sid=5224213" target="_top">SkyScanner</a><img src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-9165033-12532525" width="1" height="1" border="0"/> or <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9165033-12183441?sid=5224213" target="_top">Vayama </a><img src="http://www.tqlkg.com/image-9165033-12183441" width="1" height="1" border="0"/>

Monitor the flights you are looking at for your destination so you know when you do come across a deal. Once you decide where you are going, it doesn't mean you have to book the flight right away.

<a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9165033-13252719?sid=5224213" target="_top"> United Airlines flight deals </a><img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-9165033-13252719" width="1" height="1" border="0"/>

**TIP:** Sometimes it maybe cheaper to fly to a different city and catch a flight from there. IE: If there is a deal from Miami to Brazil, but the price from Atlanta to Brazil is much higher, look into if its cheaper to from from Atlanta to Miami to Brazil.

I have searching for flights on a Tues, Wed or Thurs morning is cheaper than searching on other days or evenings.

Look at one way trips to and from your destinations instead of only looking at round trips.  A lot of times you will find cheaper deals.

If you are a spontaneous traveler then look into last minute deals**_<last minute deals link>_**. This are great if your schedule allows it.

### Book Tours

I know i sound like a broken record and this isn't even a sponsored blog. But i really do love <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates </a>. We book most of our tours using Viator. But we also activate Ebates.

I original used Viator for the first time when i booked some tours for my Aunt and her family in Las Vegas.  After that we use Viator for all our bookings we do in any country it is offered. We have used it in Las Vegas (Grand Canyon ...), London (Day Tour to Stonehenge, Windsor & Bath)  & Italy (Pompeii, Vatican City ...)

* It was very simple to use and book
* Tickets are refundable up to a certain period before travel
* Book your tickets and if a 20% coupon comes up before you travel, then cancel the original booking and re-book, its that simple
* They have so many tours and ticketing available there is no real need to go anywhere else
* Service to date (completed over 20+ tours with them) have been great

**TIP:** Book your tour (ensure its cancel-able), then keep your eyes peeled for a coupon. The coupons don't come out too often, but give you great savings if you are able to grab it.

### Book Transportation

Of course once again <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates </a> comes into play, if the site allows it. Some will some will not.

Not all places you travel will require a car, so think about this carefully before you go ahead and book a car.  A lot of places public transportation is sufficient and very easy to use. Trains & Buses in Europe are exceptional.

**TIPS:** If you do book a car ensure you take up the full protection insurance. Yes it costs money but better safe than sorry. Someone is our group was glad he got the insurance after his accident.

Get an International Drivers license. Not all countries require it, but some will not let you rent a car unless you have it.

These are the places we did and did not need a car

* London - Underground & Buses were fine
* Scotland - We rented a car as we were driving around the Highlands
* Italy - Trains were great, did not need a car at all. We did a lot of walking
* Ireland - We rented a car because we drove around the island.
* Caribbean Islands - Only need a car if you plan to travel around the Island.
* China - Hard to tell, we did this as part of a Tour.
* Greece - Only hired a car for an overnight trip to Delphi from Athens, otherwise not needed.

Ideally you want to cover to stay as central to most attractions as possible but also close to public transportation (like train stations). You want to have your accommodations and flights all booked well in advance of travel, and you want to have your days some what planned. We tend to book a lot in a day because we want to cover as much ground as possible, but if you like to relax, then only plan about half to three quarter days  worth of stuff, so you can chill the rest of the time.
