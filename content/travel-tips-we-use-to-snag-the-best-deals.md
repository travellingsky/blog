How to create your own Itinerary & plan your next trip

The key to travel is Plan Plan Plan. Yes there are spontaneous people our there and that's great if it works for you, but if your trying to travel on a budget then planning is the best way to go.

I'm going to share with you some tips and tricks we use when traveling. I'll update this blog as I come across more tricks, so make you you subscribe at the bottom of this blog for updates :)

Our vacations vary from either a couples trip (my husband and I), family trip (us and our kids) or trips with friends and family. Our record has been 16 people on a trip with us (including a 2 year old baby)

## 1) Choose a few Destinations

Are there a list of places you really want to go, but just don't know where to start? We like to travel 1 country at a time, maybe adding a 2nd country if its going to be a short vacation to do only 1. We keep our options open.

So my husband and I, sit down and discuss where we would like to go next for our vacation. This is usually a general conversation over breakfast or lunch or even when we are walking outside, nothing formal.

We think of places where we think we may only need 5-7 days and other locations that may need more time like 10-12 days.

Then my husband gets to work. Yes he does most of the planning, and I do the guiding or approving at the end. On the odd occasion i will look something up but I get a verbal rundown on everything so i'm generally good.

**NOTE :** You want to be able to book your next vacation at least 2-3 months in advance but our big vacations (10 days or more) we generally book 6 months in advance. Why so early you may ask? Because we are prepared to go on our next tour and deals area better when you book early vs book 2-3 months earlier. Also we find that most hotels are booked way out in advance in the time period we usually like to vacation, so we like to be ahead of the game.

Book 2-3 months in advance. We book almost 6 months earlier

## 2) Plan your ideal Trip

So once we have decided on a couple of places we would like to visit, its time to research. What is ideal for us maybe not be ideal for you, but you can give it ago. We are not big on taking tours. Til date we have only done 1 tour together which was great but it has its up's and down's. Check out my China Blog for our experiences on that.

We actually have folders we create on our desktop with plans for different countries we want to visit. In the folders we start gathering information about what there is to do in each country, what actually interests us. To help us along the way, we took at different tours that are available from different websites. We mainly look at GateOne Travels, TravelZoo tours and other peoples blogs to help guide us to our ideal vacation.

We take the highlights from each itinerary and create our own. This way we can add or remove cities, places we are or are not interested in visiting.

This does take a bit of time, but once complete the hard part is done.

Soon you will have a 10-12 day itinerary,  or a 5-6 day itinerary ready to be executed, knowing how long you need in each place is important, because once the deal is available you wont have time to go and do the research then, so advance planning is key. Its less likely that you will go back to the same place again if you have only missed one or two spots so you want to cover as much as you can.

If you like relaxing vacations then, this also works, pick what is important to you and plan some quite evenings out or time at the beach. If you know what you want to do then, it becomes simple.

## 3) Choose the best time for you

The hard task is done. You have a few different itinerary's, you may even have more if you have a whole list of places to visit but cant decide which one first.

Think about which is the best time for you to take your trip, this is important so you know which dates to search for.  Things about do you have hard dates you must follow, or can you adjust your schedule here or there. Our dates are usually hard dates, because of my husbands work schedule, to maximize our time off, without hurting his work schedule.

We take our major vacation (10-12 days) at the end of May beginning of June. Right when school is out for us here in Georgia. Kids are tired and we also need a break, but its the only real time to take such a long vacation without missing school. But others have different schedules, so think carefully about when is a good time for you to travel.

Weekend vacations we like to make use of the long weekends, and my husband and I like to take our couples vacation during the second half of the year when school is on. My thinking is, if school is out then the kids should come with us. I don't want to leave them with others when they are off, but if they are at school they are busy, so you don't feel so guilty leaving them behind ;)

## 4) Download Ebates

<ebates banner>

Believe me when I say to download [Ebates](https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187 "Ebates"). Originally I was a little skeptical as well, who gives you cash back for no reason right. Well wrong. To date and I have only been using Ebates for about a year or so, I've earned almost $1000 doing the things I would have done normally anyway. This doesn't apply only to travel but on all online purchases I do. I will be honest, i haven't had much luck with Ebates and Amazon, since Amazon doesn't allow cashback on everything, but Kohls, Macy's, Groupon has saved me a lot of money.

Without getting too side tracked, Ebates actually works with travel booking sites as well. 

Its very simple. All you have to do is sign up for Ebates (which is free), and download the plugin onto your internet bar at the top. You can also install the mobile app on your phone as well.

**Downside** is that you have to activate the plugin each time you do a booking. If you activate it and don't make a purchase or return a purchase you just won't get credited, so not harm done.

**Upside** is that you get free money. see above these bookings we did back in January. 

We didn't actually take these vacations until June and July. A few weeks after we completed these vacations, we got the credit to our account, and at the end of the quarter we received a Big Fat Check in the mail. (Yep that's what Rakuten calls it).

After experimenting with shopping, and I saw the benefits my husband is also now well training to use Ebates. Its the best app ever in my opinion and did I say its FREE.

### How to use it

After you have downloaded [Ebates](https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187 "Ebates") onto your computer, and each time you go to a website the Purple R will start flashing or a popup with display letting you know that you can activate the deal. Hit The red button to activate and your in business. Just remember make sure the button is clicked on your session for your purchase to be recorded. I always click the Purple R right before i checkout just to double check. Cos even $1 or $2 here and there actually adds up. I use the [Honey App](joinhoney.com/ref/km8i18 "Honey") as well but I personally like Ebates better. Try them both.
