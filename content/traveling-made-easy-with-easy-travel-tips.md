1. Use coupons and <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates</a> wherever possible
2. Ensure everything you book is cancel-able unless you are 100% certain nothing is going to change. Flights are usually not cancel-able so book this last, but Hotels, tours and Car Rentals you can find cancel-able ones.
3. Map out each day of your itinerary. It can be as detailed or not detailed as you like, but just to ensure you cover everything you want to cover and ensure you have enough time

So your vacation is now booked. Super exciting. Isn't it an awesome feeling knowing that you will actually be going to a place you've always wanted to go. So what next?

## Cell Phone

In this day and age, you need a cell phone. If you don't have one that's fine, there is always Maps, but we find this essential

* Ensure that you have an international plan on your phone.
* Make sure when you land at your destination you turn your Roaming on (On an Iphone its usually under Cellular in Settings)
* Ensure you have a charger and adapter on you all the time. The battery on cellphones generally drain faster on roaming.

  ### Must have Cell Phone Apps
* Most people have Google Maps on there phone, but if you do not, then please install it. (its removes the need for a physical map and helps with walking routes and public transportation as well as if you hire a car)
* Google Translate is also an App that should should always have installed. Especially if you are travelling to a country where English is not there primary language.

  The first time we came across this wonderful tool was while we were travelling in Italy. Yes mostly everything was in English, but we went to a Local Italian restaurant in Naples and the menu was in Italian. This was the first time i personally used Google Translate. The Italian downloadable was already installed so we didn't have any issue

  The second time we needed Google Translate was in China. We went on a Tour, so English wasn't a problem, except the day we landed. My husband and I heading out of the hotel to grab a bite to eat. Issue was, no-one spoke English and we could not read the menu. It was funny but also a little stressful, because we didn't know what to order.

  We also HAD NOT installed the download file and the internet was not very good. We made it thru dinner by ordering mimicking a chicken and so on so forth. We went back to the hotel and download the Chinese downloadable file to avoid any more confusion like this.

## Travel Light

Travel Light is not something we are good at, but if you travel like we do from city to city, the best way is to travel light. We actually have friends who will travel for almost 3 weeks with only 1 carry on each. We are still learning from our mistakes ;)

### Benefits of traveling light

* Easy to commute from location to location, esp by train
* You don't have to wait at baggage claim to pick up your bags
* You can actually get away by hiring a smaller car rather than something large
* Less laundry to do when you get home

The above picture is what NOT TO DO. Luggage was for 15 people for a 2 week vacation, but as fun as it was, the guys did not appreciate so much luggage ;)

### So how to pack?

1) Firstly start with a handbag for each person travelling, and take out all you plan to take.

2) Start rolling your clothes. I know it sounds strange, but honestly rolling your clothes takes up less space. I personally didn't believe that myself until I tried it.

Basically, fold each item in half (maybe group a top and bottom together) and roll the item as tight as possible. Maybe even put around a rubber band around the clothing if it doesn't stay. Put each top and bottom together if its easier to find.

3) Take Travel size items like shampoo's, conditioners, body wash, mouthwash, toothpaste... or just buy it once you get there esp in European countries like England, there is a store on every corner.

**IMPORTANT**

Has an International Cell Phone Plan and set roaming to On

Make sure you have installed Google Maps

Make sure you have installed Google Translate and downloaded the country file.

Ensure you have roaming set to ON, on your cell phone(s)
