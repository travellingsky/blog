if you haven't booked your next vacation or are not sure how, refer to my blog, for <a href="https://www.skytravelblogger.com/travel-booking-tips/"> Travel Booking Tips</a>, for tips to make the most of your money when booking and planning your next vacation. 

The key to travel is

* Plan
* Look for great deals
* Keep an eye out on last minute deals

* Use coupons and <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/SHETAL23?eeid=28187" rel="nofollow">Ebates</a> wherever possible
* Ensure everything you book is cancel-able unless you are 100% certain nothing is going to change. Flights are usually not cancel-able so book this last, but Hotels, tours and Car Rentals you can find cancel-able ones.
* Prebook Tours - when you are on a time limit you dont want to go searching for things to do
* Map out each day of your itinerary. It can be as detailed or not detailed as you like, but just to ensure you cover everything you want to cover and ensure you have enough time

So your vacation is now booked. Super exciting. Isn't it an awesome feeling knowing that you will actually be going to a place you've always wanted to go. So what next?

## Cell Phone

In this day and age, you need a cell phone. If you don't have one that's fine, there is always Maps, but we find this essential

* Ensure that you have an international plan on your phone.
* Make sure when you land at your destination you turn your Roaming on (On an Iphone its usually under Cellular in Settings)
* Ensure you have a charger and adapter on you all the time. The battery on cellphones generally drain faster on roaming.

### Must have Cell Phone Apps

* Most people have Google Maps on there phone, but if you do not, then please install it. (its removes the need for a physical map and helps with walking routes and public transportation as well as if you hire a car)
* Google Translate is also an App that should should always have installed. Especially if you are travelling to a country where English is not there primary language.

  The first time we came across this wonderful tool was while we were travelling in Italy. Yes mostly everything was in English, but we went to a Local Italian restaurant in Naples and the menu was in Italian. This was the first time i personally used Google Translate. The Italian downloadable was already installed so we didn't have any issue

  The second time we needed Google Translate was in China. We went on a Tour, so English wasn't a problem, except the day we landed. My husband and I heading out of the hotel to grab a bite to eat. Issue was, no-one spoke English and we could not read the menu. It was funny but also a little stressful, because we didn't know what to order.

  We also HAD NOT installed the download file and the internet was not very good. We made it thru dinner by ordering mimicking a chicken and so on so forth. We went back to the hotel and download the Chinese downloadable file to avoid any more confusion like this.

Learn some basic phrases before you go. Like "Hello", "Thank you", "Good bye" and whatever else you can think off, it makes life easier when you are there, and the locals like to see you making an effort.

## Travel Light

Travel Light is not something we are good at, but if you travel like we do from city to city, the best way is to travel light. We actually have friends who will travel for almost 3 weeks with only 1 carry on each. We are still learning from our mistakes ;)

### Benefits of traveling light

* Easy to commute from location to location, esp by train
* You don't have to wait at baggage claim to pick up your bags
* You can actually get away by hiring a smaller car rather than something large
* Less laundry to do when you get home

The above picture is what NOT TO DO. Luggage was for 15 people for a 2 week vacation, but as fun as it was, the guys on the trip did not appreciate so much luggage ;)

### So how to pack?

* BAG - Firstly start with a handbag for each person travelling, and take out all you plan to take.
* TOILETRIES - Take Travel size items like shampoo's, conditioners, body wash, mouthwash, toothpaste... or just buy it once you get there esp in European countries like England, there is a store on every corner.

<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>

* CLOTHING - Limit your tops and bottoms. For every bottom match at least 3-4 tops

Do take extra pairs of underwear. Tops and bottoms can be repeated, I wouldn't repeat underwear though.

If possible, plan your outfits so you know exactly what you need, and maybe take an extra couple for options. I like options, but i sometimes go overboard.

If there is a possibility to do laundry in the middle of the trip then take less stuff

* SHOES - Take 1 walking/running shoe, 1 flip flops or sandals and 1 pair of heals for female. You really wont use more.
* PACKING - Start rolling your clothes. I know it sounds strange, but honestly rolling your clothes takes up less space. I personally didn't believe that myself until I tried it.

Basically, fold each item in half (maybe group a top and bottom together) and roll the item as tight as possible. Maybe even put around a rubber band around the clothing if it doesn't stay. Put each top and bottom together if its easier to find.

* DON'T NEED ITEMS - Some people like to take there own towels on vacation with them. Its really not needed. All hotels/models provide you with those basic amenities.

## Make copies Documents.

Make copies of your important documents. EG: Passport, Itinerary, Green Cards, Tour Information, Bookings ...

This is mostly never needed, but very useful if WiFi or cellular doesn't work somewhere or you loose the originals.

<div id="amzn-assoc-ad-2a7d3468-9361-48a7-a94c-485c7f211a3d"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=2a7d3468-9361-48a7-a94c-485c7f211a3d"></script>

Keep the information on you like booking info etc, but keep another copy in one of the bags that you are not necessarily carrying around with you. We also tend to keep a copy in our drop box so we can access it wherever we maybe if we need it.

## Take Cash

Most places take Credit Cards for payment, but take cash as well. A lot of people tell us its cheaper to convert currently in the country you go to, but we have not found this to be the cash.

Its very simple to visit your local bank and get a couple of hundred dollars converted to the currency you need.

Also don't carry all the cash with you at the same time. Carry limited cash or spread it between the people you are with, to avoid being pick pocketed in some places. You don't want to loose it all.

## Haggle

In USA, we don't tend to Haggle. But its a skill worth adopting. Most stores overseas will not haggle, but if its a small mom and pop store or a stall along the side of the road, then you can always try to get a bargain.

Don't be rude, but also don't be afraid to walk away from a item, if they don't budge on the price. I have literally left stores before and they have come after me.  If you show too much interest in an item, then they are not going to go down on the price.

If you buy a few items vs 1 item, you have more of a chance of getting a deal.

## Females - Carry a backpack

Carry a backpack instead of a purse while travelling. Pic-pocketing is very common in tourist areas, so you want to stay well protected.

The best way I have found to protect myself is to carry a Backpack that has a zip on the pack. This is where i keep my cash and credit cards and my cellphone.

All my other items, I keep in the main pockets that i'm not too worried about loosing.

We have experienced pic-pocketing in Italy before. We were catching a bus and all of a sudden a ruckus started up. Apparently there were a group of young females who were acting like they were also catching the bus and they pic-pocketed another male riding the bus, but got caught. The girl was thrown off the bus, and her friends got off with her. It was rather interesting to see how it works, but after witnessing that, i noticed my backpack had also been opened from the back. Nothing was missing since i didn't think they were interested in water bottles, a hairbrush and other girly stuff so i guess i lucked out.

So its best to be safe, and keep all important items as close to your body as possible.

## Adapter & Converter

You always want to travel overseas with a International Adapter & Converter. We take ours wherever we go, and other family members use it as well.

Voltage & Plus in other countries is different and whether you need to charge your phones, camera batteries, use your hair straightener, or any other devices you will need an adapter and/or converter.

An adapter lets you plug your device into the other countries power outlet

A converter converts the voltage to USA to the other countries power voltage.

<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>

For things like a hair straightener or hair dryer, I suggest buying a dual voltage appliance esp for travel, because they use a lot of power, the appliance can blowup if it is not adaptable.
