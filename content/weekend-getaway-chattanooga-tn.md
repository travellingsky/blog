Sometimes it’s the last-minute trips that are so much fun. Fortunately living in Atlanta, Georgia is the perfect distance away from so many nearby states. A holiday weekend approached and deciding what we should do was a small dilemma because we only had 1 night, we could spend away due to a family event that we had committed too.

We decided we were going to visit <a href="[https://www.lookoutmountain.com/](https://www.lookoutmountain.com/ "https://www.lookoutmountain.com/")" rel="nofollow">Lookout Mountain</a> in <a href="[https://www.chattanoogafun.com/](https://www.chattanoogafun.com/ "https://www.chattanoogafun.com/")"rel="nofollow">Chattanooga, Tennessee.</a> A beautiful little city only about 2 hours away from downtown Atlanta was the perfect destination. So many great activities and things to do and the perfect little getaway for the kids after a busy month at school.

We arrived in Chattanooga at around 11am and headed straight to <a href="[https://www.rubyfalls.com/](https://www.rubyfalls.com/ "https://www.rubyfalls.com/")"rel="nofollow">Ruby Falls</a>. Having visited Ruby Falls many times more than 7-10 years ago, and never having issues with tickets, we hadn’t bought tickets ahead of time. Our mistake ☹

**ADVICE:** Buy tickets online ahead of time especially if you are planning to visit during a holiday weekend.

We were not able to get tickets until 6.45pm. A bit of a long wait but for us that was ok, since we had other things we could do in between. After buying the package deal for Ruby Falls and Rock City, we started to head to Rock City.

On the way we came across this beautiful little cafe called <a href="[http://www.cafeonthecornerlookoutmountain.com/menu](http://www.cafeonthecornerlookoutmountain.com/menu "http://www.cafeonthecornerlookoutmountain.com/menu")"rel="nofollow">Café on the Corner</a>. It was the perfect spot to stop for brunch. The cafe is located on a Y intersection, with very tidy and clean indoor seating with lovely outdoor patio seating as well. We sat indoor due to the heat, but if it wasn’t so hot, outdoors would have been wonderful. A lot of people were sitting outdoors under the right red umbrellas.

The little Cafe was very reasonable priced with many options for food to suit everyone’s taste buds. It was perfect. Chicken & Waffles was great for the kids, my 12-year-old loved it. The Poached Egg and Fried Green Tomato on Biscuit was fantastic. This place was a great choice for lunch. They also have $2 mimosa’s on Sunday which was a bonus on top of the great food. This is a place I would revisit next time we visit this area for sure.

## Rock City

1400 Patten Rd

Lookout Mountain, GA 30750

We finally made it to <a href="[https://www.seerockcity.com](https://www.seerockcity.com "https://www.seerockcity.com")"rel="nofollow">Rock City</a>. Rock City is one of my favorite spots in Chattanooga located on top of Lookout Mountain. I love the fact that each corner of the park is different, they make it fun for everyone with funny little names for the different sections that make it interesting to explore. Places like the Grand Corridor, Needle’s Eye, Gnome Valley and so many more make it fun and interesting. If you’re Gnome fan, then keep your eyes wide open, there are many of them hiding amongst the different bushes and spots.

The park was a little busy since it was a holiday weekend and the heat was scorching, but nevertheless it was a fun afternoon in the sun. Kids loved the swing-a-long bridge and jumping on it making it shake just to scare me. They had fun with it. The pathways are so cute, it kind of makes you feel like your walking thru a fairytale. Its unique and looks so natural since everything is made from rocks.

The main attraction at Rock City is the Lovers Leap. The large open area high above on top of the mountains is the perfect spot to view 7 states (Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.) This is a great hang out spot, perfect places to wait for others in your group to catch up and a great place to a bite to eat or grab an ice cream, while you enjoy the beauty of the surrounding area.

The Observation Point is the perfect spot to see the High Falls waterfall. Great spot for pictures and viewing point for the mountains surrounding the wonderful city. I love looking at waterfalls, they just seem so peaceful, and the sound of the water running is just so surreal.

After exploring the park more we made it to the end. The kids loved this part, 12 & 15-year-old boys, but they loved the fairytale section, it was kind of cute, watching them singing the nursery rhymes. This section is a cavern and within the openings little stories themes have been created. Everything is lighted up so well with neon colors, and the creativity of this section is so amazing. It’s worth checking out. After going thru the cavern, you enter a large room, where an entire city is created based of different nursery rhymes and riddles. I can’t even put into words how wonderful this is, even for grownups and older kids it takes you back in the day.

## Ruby Falls

1720 South Scenic Hwy 

Chattanooga, TN 37409

After a wonderful afternoon at <a href="[https://www.seerockcity.com](https://www.seerockcity.com "https://www.seerockcity.com")"rel="nofollow">Rock City</a>, we headed back to <a href="[https://www.rubyfalls.com/](https://www.rubyfalls.com/ "https://www.rubyfalls.com/")"rel="nofollow">Ruby Falls</a> (after we freshened up at our hotel).

I wasn’t sure if this is something the kids would like, but they loved it. They liked it more than Rock City even, but I think the heat had a lot to do with that.

Ruby Falls is great, since we had booked our time slot, we were taken in right on time. After travelling down the elevator approx. 260 ft, we entered the cave. A short history lesson later we were on our way. Even after hearing this history multiple times earlier, it’s still fascinating information, and kids were very interested in the story.

Kids learned all about stalagmites and stalactites and managed to see many of them along the way.

The cave is made interesting for the young and the old, as there are labels everywhere with to give you a representation of different things. Very creatively thought of, you see things like Crystal Chandeliers, a Donkey, Leaning Tower, Dragons Foot, Beehives and so much more. The whole theme of this cave is very well thought out, but especially in the holidays its best to book in advance, since the tour guide told us there are approximately 3000+ people who travel through the cave daily.

Of course, the highlight of the Cave is Ruby Falls. As you get closer to the end of the cave, the lights are switched off, and you enter this open area, where all you hear is the water. The lights get switched on and a breathtaking scene is in front of you. The beautiful waterfall right before your eyes, is extraordinarily perfect. You really don’t want to leave this area, but you must move on. Explorers are unsure where this water comes from, they have tried to follow the upstream flow but have been unsuccessful.

## White Water Rafting – Ocoee River

The following day before heading back home, we had bought a <a href="[https://www.groupon.com/deals/high-country-adventures-16-24](https://www.groupon.com/deals/high-country-adventures-16-24 "https://www.groupon.com/deals/high-country-adventures-16-24")" rel="nofollow">Groupon</a> for White Water Rafting

The kids had never done this before so it was a treat for them, and we had been waiting for our youngest to turn 12 before we do this, since there is an age restriction on this activity.

Kids had the thrill of their life, they sat in the front of the raft because that’s where most of the splashing happens, and we were off. 6 people on a raft and 2 kids, 1 newbie and us, it was a fun cruise down the river. We worked on spinning the raft over some high rapids, nosedived the raft (so water poured in the front), and so many other cool tricks that were up to the guides discretion Just like the other 2 places we visited the Ocoee River had names some of its rapids as well. Double Trouble, fast, Tablesaw and Hell Hole Rapid.

The rapids were between level 2-4, so it was a nice mix of rapids which made it fun and enjoyable without being too crazy especially for first timers and luckily no one in our raft fell out. There were several fall outs from other rafts, but no injuries. In the middle in a calm spot all the guides did stop to let people jump off the raft and enjoy the cold 65-degree water. The staff were fun, and very helpful. They made it entertaining and enjoyable for everyone there. I know for sure we will be back here again very shortly.

Our weekend getaway was then over and we headed back home. This trip was an overnight getaway for couples of families if you are short on time, and live close to one of the neighboring states. Definitely a trip doing at least once.
